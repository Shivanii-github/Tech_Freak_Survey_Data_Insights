Data Survey Insights 📊

This repository contains data on the performance and well-being of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. 
The dataset includes various aspects like academic performance, sleep patterns, mental health status, and more. 
It can be used to explore the intersection of student life, well-being, and academic success.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:
- Age: Age of the student
- Gender: Gender of the student
- Academic Performance: Categories include Average, Good, and Excellent
- Taking Notes in Class: Whether the student takes notes (Yes/No)
- Depression Status: Mental health status (Yes, No, Sometimes)
- Challenges in Academic Tasks: Difficulty level in academic tasks
- Presentation Preference: Preference for giving presentations (Yes/No)
- Sleep Hours: Average hours of sleep per day
- Number of Friends: Approximate count of friends
- Interest in New Things: Interest in exploring new experiences (Yes/No)

 Use Cases 🌐
1. IoT-Based Student Monitoring System
Integrate this dataset with IoT devices such as smart wearables to monitor sleep patterns, stress levels, and academic performance. 
This can provide real-time alerts for students at risk and suggest personalized interventions.

 2. Predictive Analytics for Student Success
Leverage machine learning models to predict academic performance based on behavioral patterns like sleep, note-taking, and social interactions.

3. Mental Health Insights
Identify correlations between sleep, social life, and mental health status to provide better support for students facing academic or personal challenges.
